NAME
       pstrackd - psnet tracker daemon

SYNOPSIS
       pstrackd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  psnet  tracker daemon maintains a list of psnet routers and serves
       it to clients (including psnet routers) on demand.  Each  psnet  router
       theoretically  corresponds  to  a  single,  disjoint network, though in
       practice topologies may be  more  complicated  (for  example,  if  some
       routers connect to multiple trackers).

OPTIONS
       -l, --listen-port <port>
              The port to listen on for client requests.

       -t, --max-threads <threads>
              The maximum number of clients to service concurrently.

FILES
       /etc/psnetrc
              Config  file.   Any option that can be given on the command line
              can be given in this file instead.  Option names are the same as
              the  long version of the corresponding command line option (e.g.
              "max-threads=1000").  Settings for the tracker should  be  under
              the "Tracker" section in this file.
