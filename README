NAME
       psnet protocol - protocol of the psnet overlay network

DESCRIPTION
       psnet  is  an  overlay network that serves as middleware for unreliable
       broadcast messaging.

PROCESSES
       psdird
              The "directory" server.  This process is responsible  for  main-
              taining  a  list of routers available on the network.  It should
              be run at a well-known address so that routers and clients  know
              where to find it.

       psnoded
              The  overlay  router,  or node.  This process is responsible for
              maintaining a list of connected clients, delivering messages  to
              them,  and  forwarding messages sent by their clients for broad-
              cast.

CONNECTIONS
       psdird and psnoded maintain virtual "connections" to their clients over
       UDP,  by  means  of keep-alive messages.  In the case of psdird clients
       are routers, and the purpose of the connection is to have the directory
       advertise  the  router's  location both to other routers in the network
       and to potential clients.  psnoded clients are processes  which  intend
       to  send  or  receive  broadcast  messages.  They connect to routers in
       order to receive broadcast messages from them.

JOINING THE NETWORK
       The psnet directory serves as the entry point into  the  network,  both
       for  routers  and  for their clients.  When a router or client wants to
       join to the network, they request  information  about  some  number  of
       routers  from the directory (a "list request").  A router can then con-
       nect to the directory (in order to gain clients) and  begin  forwarding
       messages  to  the  routers  it  learned about from the list request.  A
       client may simply request information about a single  router  and  then
       connect to it.

       In  case  the  directory is unavailable, but the address of a router is
       known, clients may send list requests to routers.  They may also send a
       "directory  request" to discover the location of a directory, if one is
       available (XXX: not implemented!).

MESSAGES
       The psnet protocol uses JSON for messages.  The structure of any  psnet
       message is either:

       {
           [key]: [value],
           ...
       }

       where  keys  are  strings  and  values are (potentially) any valid JSON
       value, or:

       [{"ip":[ip], "port":[port], "ipv":[ip version]}, ...]

       in the case of list and discover requests, where [ip] is an IP address,
       [port] is a port number, and [ip version] is either 4 or 6.

       Any message of variable length will begin with a header, as follows:

       {
           "status":[status],
           "size":[size],
           ...
       }

       where  [size]  is  the  length, in bytes, of the message body.  Headers
       must be less than 512 bytes in length,  and  end  in  the  double  CRLF
       sequence.

MESSAGE TYPES
       connect
              The  purpose  of  a  connect message is to maintain a connection
              with either a psnet directory or router.  Note that there is  no
              distinction between establishing and maintaining a connection in
              psnet.  The message structure is:

              {
                  "method":"connect",
                  "port":[port]
              }

              where [port] is the port the client is listening  on  for  psnet
              messages.  This message should be sent over UDP.

       disconnect
              The  purpose  of a disconnect message is to promptly terminate a
              connection with either a psnet directory or  router.   Depending
              on the configuration of the directory or router, prompt termina-
              tion may be  desirable;  however,  if  the  server's  expiration
              interval  is small, it may be better to simply discontinue send-
              ing connect messages.  The message structure is:

              {
                  "method":"disconnect",
                  "port":[port]
              }

              where [port] is the port the client has previously advertised to
              the server.  This message should be sent over UDP.

       list
              The  purpose  of  a  list  message  is  to  request  the network
              addresses of some number of psnet routers, from either a  direc-
              tory or a router.  The message structure is:

              {
                  "method":"list",
                  "num":[num]
              }

              where [num] is the (maximum) number of addresses which should be
              returned.  The structure of the response  is  described  in  the
              MESSAGES section.

       discover
              Discover  messages  are much like list messages, except that the
              address of the requesting client will not  be  included  in  the
              response.  The message structure is:

              {
                  "method":"discover",
                  "num":[num],
                  "port":[port]
              }

              where [num] is the (maximum) number of addresses which should be
              returned, and [port] is the port number  the  requesting  entity
              has  previously  advertised to the server.  The structure of the
              response is described in the MESSAGES section.

       info
              The purpose of an info message is to request  information  about
              the state of a directory or router. The message structure is:

              {
                  "method":"info"
              }

              A router will respond as follows:

              {
                  "name":[name],
                  "clients":[clients],
                  "cache-load":[load]
              }

              where [name] is some string identifying the router, [clients] is
              the number of clients connected to the router, and [load] is the
              number of messages in the router's message cache.  This informa-
              tion may be used to select an underutilized router from  a  list
              obtained by a list or discover request.

              A directory will respond as follows:

              {
                  "name":[name]
              }

              where [name] is some string identifying the directory.

       broadcast
              A  message intended for broadcast to all clients in the network.
              The message structure is:

              {
                  "method":"broadcast",
                  "hops":0,
                  "id":[id],
                  "data":[data]
              }

              where [id] is a string identifying the message,  and  [data]  is
              any  valid JSON value.  Clients should take care to choose an ID
              that is unlikely to be in use already, since routers use IDs  to
              filter  duplicate  messages.  If two IDs match, one will be con-
              sidered a duplicate and it will  be  discarded.   On  the  other
              hand,  two  clients  might  deliberately send identical messages
              (with identical IDs) in order to increase network penetration or
              to increase the speed of delivery.
