.SH NAME
psdird \- psnet directory daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psdird [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The psnet directory daemon maintains a list of psnet routers and serves it to
clients (including psnet routers) on demand.  Each psnet router theoretically
corresponds to a single, disjoint network, though in practice topologies may be
more complicated (for example, if some routers connect to multiple
directories).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-l, --listen-port <port>"
The port to listen on for client requests.
.IP "-t, --max-threads <threads>"
The maximum number of clients to service concurrently.
.SH FILES
.I /etc/psnetrc
.RS
Config file.  Any option that can be given on the command line can be given in
this file instead.  Option names are the same as the long version of the
corresponding command line option (e.g. "max-threads=1000").  Settings for
the directory should be under the "Directory" section in this file.
