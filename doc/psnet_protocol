.TH PSNET_PROTOCOL 7 "MAY 2013" Linux "PSNet Manual"
.SH NAME
psnet protocol \- protocol of the PSNet overlay network
.SH DESCRIPTION
PSNet is an overlay network that serves as middleware for unreliable broadcast
messaging.
.SH PROCESSES
.B psdird
.RS
The "directory" server.  This process is responsible for maintaining a list of
routers available on the network.  It should be run at a well-known address so
that routers and clients know where to find it.
.RE

.B psnoded
.RS
The overlay router, or node.  This process is responsible for maintaining a list
of connected clients, delivering messages to them, and forwarding messages sent
by their clients for broadcast.
.SH CONNECTIONS
.B psdird
and
.B psnoded
maintain virtual "connections" to their clients over UDP, by means of keep-alive
messages.  In the case of
.B psdird
clients are routers, and the purpose of the connection is to have the directory
advertise the router's location both to other routers in the network and to
potential clients.
.B psnoded
clients are processes which intend to send or receive broadcast messages.  They
connect to routers in order to receive broadcast messages from them.
.SH "JOINING THE NETWORK"
The PSNet directory serves as the entry point into the network, both for routers
and for their clients.  When a router or client wants to join to the network,
they request information about some number of routers from the directory (a
"list request").  A router can then connect to the directory (in order to gain
clients) and begin forwarding messages to the routers it learned about from the 
list request.  A client may simply request information about a single router and then connect to it.

In case the directory is unavailable, but the address of a router is known,
clients may send list requests to routers.  They may also send a "directory
request" to discover the location of a directory, if one is available (XXX: not
implemented!).
.SH MESSAGES
The PSNet protocol uses JSON for messages.  The structure of any PSNet message
is either:

{
    [key]: [value],
    ...
.sp 0
}

where keys are strings and values are (potentially) any valid JSON value, or:

[{"ip":[ip], "port":[port], "ipv":[ip version]}, ...]

in the case of list and discover requests, where [ip] is an IP address, [port]
is a port number, and [ip version] is either 4 or 6.

Any message of variable length will begin with a header, as follows:

{
    "status":[status],
    "size":[size],
    ...
.sp 0
}

where [size] is the length, in bytes, of the message body.  Headers must be
less than 512 bytes in length, and end in the double CRLF sequence.
.SH "MESSAGE TYPES"
.I connect
.RS
The purpose of a
.I connect
message is to maintain a connection with either a PSNet directory or router.
Note that there is no distinction between establishing and maintaining a
connection in PSNet.  The message structure is:

{
    "method":"connect",
    "port":[port]
.sp 0
}

where [port] is the port the client is listening on for PSNet messages.  This
message should be sent over UDP.
.RE

.I disconnect
.RS
The purpose of a
.I disconnect
message is to promptly terminate a connection with either a PSNet directory or
router.  Depending on the configuration of the directory or router, prompt
termination may be desirable; however, if the server's expiration interval is
small, it may be better to simply discontinue sending
.I connect
messages.  The message structure is:

{
    "method":"disconnect",
    "port":[port]
.sp 0
}

where [port] is the port the client has previously advertised to the server.
This message should be sent over UDP.
.RE

.I list
.RS
The purpose of a
.I list
message is to request the network addresses of some number of PSNet routers,
from either a directory or a router.
The message structure is:

{
    "method":"list",
    "num":[num]
.sp 0
}

where [num] is the (maximum) number of addresses which should be returned.  The
structure of the response is described in the
.B MESSAGES
section.
.RE

.I discover
.RS
Discover messages are much like list messages, except that the address of the
requesting client will not be included in the response.  The message structure
is:

{
    "method":"discover",
    "num":[num],
    "port":[port]
.sp 0
}

where [num] is the (maximum) number of addresses which should be returned, and
[port] is the port number the requesting entity has previously advertised to
the server.  The structure of the response is described in the
.B MESSAGES
section.
.RE

.I info
.RS
The purpose of an
.I info
message is to request information about the state of a directory or router. The
message structure is:

{
    "method":"info"
.sp 0
}

A router will respond as follows:

{
    "name":[name],
    "clients":[clients],
    "cache-load":[load]
.sp 0
}

where [name] is some string identifying the router, [clients] is the number of
clients connected to the router, and [load] is the number of messages in the
router's message cache.  This information may be used to select an underutilized
router from a list obtained by a
.I list
or
.I discover
request.

A directory will respond as follows:

{
    "name":[name]
.sp 0
}

where [name] is some string identifying the directory.
.RE

.I broadcast
.RS
A message intended for broadcast to all clients in the network.  The message
structure is:

{
    "method":"broadcast",
    "hops":0,
    "id":[id],
    "data":[data]
.sp 0
}

where [id] is a string identifying the message, and [data] is any valid JSON
value.  Clients should take care to choose an ID that is unlikely to be in use
already, since routers use IDs to filter duplicate messages.  If two IDs match,
one will be considered a duplicate and it will be discarded.  On the other hand,
two clients might deliberately send identical messages (with identical IDs) in
order to increase network penetration or to increase the speed of delivery.
